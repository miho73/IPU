## Think, Solve, Improve

## 2. Workflow

> * All commits to main branch will be automatically sent to IPU server and distributed.
> * Most of  contents can be updated without server restart but in order to update server module, server must be restarted.
> * Commiting incomplete server to main branch may cause severe error to ACTUAL IPU server. Make sure to make branch to commit incompleted product.
> * Updating files that don't have any relation with server components is okay to be commited to main branch directly
